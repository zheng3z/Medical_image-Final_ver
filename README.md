### Run `Supervised_Learnings.ipynb` to get different models from different methods. 

- Total of five models, ` Tang et al.'s model`, `ResNet34`, `RegNet02x`, `10_percent_data`, `Transfer_learning`, generated models can be found in /models folder.

### Run `Semi_Supervised_Learning.py` to get Semi-Supervised model.

### Compare models in `Test Cases.ipynb`.
